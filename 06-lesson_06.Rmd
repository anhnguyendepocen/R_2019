## Aims

* Calculating new rasters based on one or more overlapping rasters with **raster algebra**
* Converting continuous rasters to categorical ones using raster **classification**
* Learning methods of raster **subsetting** and methods of **transforming** rasters to other data structures

## Raster subsetting

In most of the examples in this Chapter, we are going to use the `MOD13A3_2000_2019.tif` raster which we already met in Section \@ref(rasters). Let's read it into memory:

```{r}
library(stars)

r = read_stars("data/MOD13A3_2000_2019.tif")
names(r) = "NDVI"
```

Keep in mind this is a raster time series, where the "layers" refer to NDVI images taken in different times. 

The stars subset operator `[` works as follows:

* The first argument selects **attributes**
* The second argument selects the **first** dimension, usually `[x]`, or columns
* The third argument selects the **second** dimension, usually `[y]`, or rows
* And so on for the remaining dimensions, if any

We can subset a raster using indices. For example:

```{r}
s = r[, 100:102, 200:202, 1:2]
plot(round(s, 2), text_values = TRUE)
```

Another example:

```{r}
s = r[, (1:145) > 99 & (1:145) < 104, 200:203, 1:2]
plot(round(s, 2), text_values = TRUE)
```

`drop=TRUE`...

We can access a "slice" of a single pixel through all of the raster layers, as follows:

```{r}
v = r[[1]][50, 200, ]
class(v)
```

The result is a vector (why?). Plotting the vector displays a *time-series* of NDVI at a particular location (Figure \@ref(fig:single-pixel-ndvi)). 

```{r single-pixel-ndvi, fig.cap="Single pixel values across all layers"}
plot(v, type = "o")
```

The file `MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates2.csv` corresponds to the third dimension of `MOD13A3_2000_2019.tif`, containing the dates when each NDVI image was captured. This file includes the additional `season` column which we calculated in Section \@ref(table-join). Using the `MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates2.csv` table we can display dates on the x-axis: 

```{r, fig.cap="Single pixel values across all layers", fig.width=8, fig.height=5, out.width="100%"}
dates = read.csv("data/MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates2.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dates$date = as.Date(dates$date)
plot(dates$date, v, type = "o", xlab = "Time", ylab = "NDVI")
```

We can improve the interpretability of the time series if we mark seasons with different color:

```{r}
cols = c("blue", "purple", "red", "yellow")
seasons = c("winter", "spring", "summer", "fall")
```

We can use a `for` **loop** to mark the portion of the NDVI time series from each season:

```{r, fig.cap="Single pixel values across all layers"}
plot(dates$date, v, type = "l", xlab = "Time", ylab = "NDVI", col = "grey")
for(i in 1:4) {
  tmp = v
  tmp[dates$season != seasons[i]] = NA
  lines(dates$date, tmp, col = cols[i], type = "o")
}
```

> What is the meaning of the following plot?

```{r, fig.cap="Raster plot"}
x = r[,,,1][[1]]
x = as.numeric(x)
y = r[,,,2][[1]]
y = as.numeric(y)
plot(x, y, xlab = "Band 1", ylab = "Band 2")
```

## Raster dimensions

### Dimension properties

```{r}
dates = read.csv("data/MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dates$date = as.Date(dates$date)
r = st_set_dimensions(r, "band", values = dates$date, point = FALSE, names = "time")
```

### Converting a `matrix` to raster

Another example:

```{r}
d = st_dimensions(x = 1:ncol(volcano), y = 1:nrow(volcano))
volcano = st_as_stars(t(volcano))
volcano = st_set_dimensions(volcano, 1, offset = 0, delta = 1)
volcano = st_set_dimensions(volcano, 2, offset = nrow(volcano), delta = -1)
volcano = st_set_dimensions(volcano, names = c("x", "y"))
names(volcano) = "elevation"
plot(volcano)
```

Creating a sample matrix:

```{r}
v = c(NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 
NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 
NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 3, 2, 3, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 
NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 6, 3, 4, 8, 7, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,

m = matrix(v, nrow = 19, ncol = 16)
```

Creating a `stars` object from a `matrix`:

```{r}
d = st_dimensions(x = 1:ncol(m), y = 1:nrow(m))
s = st_as_stars(t(m))
s = st_set_dimensions(s, 1, offset = 34.90417, delta = 0.01333333)
s = st_set_dimensions(s, 2, offset = 32.91917, delta = -0.01333333)
s = st_set_dimensions(s, names = c("x", "y"))
s = st_set_crs(s, 4326)
names(s) = "elevation"
plot(s, text_values = TRUE)
```

## Raster algebra

### Arithmetic and logical operations on layers

Often we have one or more overlapping rasters, and we want to apply the same operation on all pairs, triplets, etc. of overlapping pixels (Figure \@ref(fig:raster-algebra)). 

```{r raster-algebra, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Raster algebra^[http://rpubs.com/etiennebr/visualraster]", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_06_raster_algebra.svg")
```

In **raster algebra**, we can use different operators - 

* Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
* Logical: `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `!`
* Certain functions: `abs`, `round`, `ceiling`, `floor`, `trunc`, `sqrt`, `log`, `log10`, `exp`, `cos`, `sin`, `max`, `min`, `range`, `prod`, `sum`, `any`, `all`

on each pair (triplet, etc.) of overlapping rasters, to get a new raster where each pixel value is the result of the given operation on the overlapping pixels in the input rasters. The operation can also include rasters and `numeric` values, as long as the first argument is a raster. 

For the next few examples, let's create two single-band rasters named `x` and `y`: 

```{r}
x = r[, , , 1]
y = r[, , , 2]
```

Here are several examples of raster algebra operations:

```{r}
plot(x + y)
```

A *logical* raster algebra operation produces a `logical` raster, a raster with pixel values `TRUE` and `FALSE`. For example: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Logical raster algebra operation"}
plot(1 * (x > 0.5))
plot(1 * (x < y))
plot(1 * is.na(x))
```

A logical raster can be used to get a subset of raster values, and possibly assign new values into the subset. For example, we can use the logical raster `is.na(r)` to replace all `NA` values in the raster `r` with a new value: 

```{r}
x1 = x
x1[is.na(x1)] = mean(x1[[1]], na.rm = TRUE)
```

* Question: what is the meaning of the expression `mean(r[], na.rm = TRUE)`?

```{r, fig.cap="Assignmnent to raster subset using logical raster (before and after)", fig.width=7, fig.height=6.85, out.width="70%"}
plot(c(x, x1, along = 3))
```

In operations where a `numeric` representation is required, such as:

* An arithmetic operation 
* Saving to a file

logical raster values `TRUE` and `FALSE` become `1` and `0`, respectively

```{r}
(is.na(x))$NDVI[1:2, 1:2, 1]
(is.na(x)*2)$NDVI[1:2, 1:2, 1]
```

> What is the *proportion* of `NA` values in `x`? And in `y`?

### Landsat image

For the following example, let's read another multi-band raster file named `landsat_04_10_2000.tif`. This is a part of a **Landsat-5** satellite image with bands 1-5 and 7, after radiometric and atmospheric corrections. The raster values represent spectral **reflectance**, therefore all values are in the range 0-1

```{r}
l = read_stars("data/landsat_04_10_2000.tif")
```

We can assign meaningful layer names according to the spectral range^[https://landsat.usgs.gov/what-are-band-designations-landsat-satellites]:

```{r}
l = st_set_dimensions(l, "band", values = c("Blue", "Green", "Red", "NIR", "SWIR1", "SWIR2"))
```

Plot:

```{r, fig.cap="Landsat satellite image, bands 1-5 and 7"}
plot(l)
```

### True color and false color images

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="RGB image^[https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-spatial-data-structures-formats/index.html]", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_06_plot_rgb.jpg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Image stretch^[https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/01-spatial-data-structures-formats/index.html]", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_06_linear_image_stretch.jpg")
```

**True color** and **false color** images can be produced with the `plot` function - 

```{r, fig.cap="True color (left) and false color (right) images", fig.width=8, fig.height=4.7, out.width="100%"}
# True color image
plot(l, rgb = c(3, 2, 1))
# False color image
plot(l, rgb = c(4, 3, 2))
```

### Calculating NDVI

**NDVI** can be calculated using raster algebra, as the difference between NIR and Red reflectance, divided by their sum:

$$NDVI=\frac{NIR-Red}{NIR + Red}$$

For example: 

```{r}
ndvi = (l[,,,4] - l[,,,3]) / (l[,,,4] + l[,,,3])
names(ndvi) = "NDVI"
```

Plot:

```{r, fig.cap="NDVI image", fig.width=5, fig.height=5.5, out.width="60%"}
plot(ndvi)
```

## Classification

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Raster classification^[http://rpubs.com/etiennebr/visualraster]", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_06_reclassify.svg")
```

The `reclassify` function can be used to **reclassify** a raster, i.e. to convert a **continuous** raster to a **categorical** one

```{r}
l_rec = ndvi
l_rec[ndvi <= 0.2] = 0
l_rec[ndvi > 0.2] = 1
```

```{r, fig.cap="Original and reclassified NDVI images", fig.width=8, fig.height=5, out.width="100%"}
plot(c(ndvi, l_rec, along = 3))
```

We can do the above reclassification with a single expression, using `cut`:

```{r}
cut(l_rec, breaks = c(-Inf, 0.2, Inf))
```

This becomes especially convenient if we have numerous categories or classes. 

## Generalizing raster algebra with `st_apply`

### Operating on each pixel

Suppose that we have a small raster named `s`, with two layers:

```{r}
s = r[, 100:103, 200:203, 1:2]
s[[1]]
```

and that we would like to add up the two layers, plus a constant value of `10`. We have already seen this is a raster algebra operation that can be achieved with arithmetic operators:

```{r}
u = s[,,,1] + s[,,,2] + 10
u[[1]]
```

But what if we want to apply a function on three, ten, or a hundred layers? Specifying each and every layer is impractical in such case. For that, we have a more general raster algebra approach using `st_apply`. The `st_apply` function is very similar to `apply`. It takes an object, the dimension indices we wish to operate on and a function. For example:

```{r}
u = st_apply(X = s, MARGIN = 1:2, FUN = function(x) sum(x) + 10)
u[[1]]
```

The `st_apply` function thus makes it possible to apply any *custom*, user-defined, raster algebra function on any number of layers (or other dimensions). In case the dimension we operate on is `1:2` (i.e., "pixels"), the `FUN` parameter determines the function which calculates each pixel value given the respective pixel values of the input raster. 

The `FUN` function needs to accept a vector of any length and return either one of the following: 

* A **vector** of **length 1**, in which case `st_apply` returns a single-band raster, or
* A **vector** of (fixed) **length n**, in which case `st_apply` returns a multi-band raster with n layers

For example, the above expression to calculate NDVI:

```{r}
ndvi = (l[,,,4] - l[,,,3]) / (l[,,,4] + l[,,,3])
```


Can be replaced with the following analogous expression using `st_apply`:

```{r}
ndvi = st_apply(l, 1:2, function(x) (x[4]-x[3])/(x[4]+x[3]))
```


As another example, the following expression uses `st_apply` along with `FUN=mean` to calculate a new raster with the average NDVI values per pixel. The additional `na.rm=TRUE` argument is passed to the function (`mean`, in this case). This makes the calculation ignore `NA` values:

```{r}
s = st_apply(r, 1:2, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Plot:

```{r, fig.cap="Average NDVI per pixel"}
plot(s)
```

In the following example we use the `range` function, which is a function that returns a vector of length 2:

```{r}
f = function(x) if(!all(is.na(x))) range(x, na.rm = TRUE) else c(NA, NA)
s = st_apply(r, 1:2, f)
```

Plot:

```{r, fig.cap="Minimum and maximum NDVI value per pixel"}
plot(s)
```

> Why does the resulting raster has two layers? What is the meaning of each layer?

As another example, we can calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum NDVI, i.e., the observed amplitude of NDVI values, in the raster `r`: 

```{r}
f = function(x) if(!all(is.na(x))) diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE)) else NA
s = st_apply(r, 1:2, f)
```

Note that the function is more complex in this case, to avoid the situation when all values are `NA` and thus a vector of length *one*, rather than two, is returned:

```{r}
diff(range(c(NA, NA, NA)))
```

* Plot - 

```{r, fig.cap="Amplitude of NDVI values per pixel"}
plot(s)
```

Another practical use case for `st_apply` is calculating the proportion of `NA` values per pixel:

```{r}
f = function(x) mean(is.na(x))
s = st_apply(r, 1:2, f)
```

Plot:

```{r, fig.cap="Proportion of `NA` values per pixel"}
plot(s)
```

### Operating on each layer

Another useful mode of operation with `st_apply` is summarizing the properties of each *layer*, rather than each pixel. This is acieved with `MARGIN=3`. For example:

```{r}
layer_mean = st_apply(r, 3, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
layer_min = st_apply(r, 3, min, na.rm = TRUE)
layer_max = st_apply(r, 3, max, na.rm = TRUE)
```

```{r}
plot(layer_mean[[1]], type = "o", ylim = range(r[[1]], na.rm = TRUE), ylab = "NDVI")
lines(layer_min[[1]], type = "o", col = "blue")
lines(layer_max[[1]], type = "o", col = "red")
```
