## Aims

* Learn to work with `data.frame`, the data structure used to represent tables in R
* Learn several automation methods for controlling code execution and automation in R - 
    * Conditionals
    * Loops
    * The `apply` function
* Install and use packages beyond "base R"
* Join between tables

## Tables

### What is a table?

* A **table** in R is represented using the `data.frame` class
* A `data.frame` is basically a collection of **vectors** comprising columns, all of the **same size** but possibly of **different types**
* Conventionally - 
    * Each row represents an **observation**, with values possibly of a **different** type for each variable
    * Each column represents a **variable**, with values of the **same** type

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\texttt{rainfall.csv} opened in Excel", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_table_in_excel.png")
```

### Creating a `data.frame`

* A `data.frame` can be **created** with the `data.frame` function, given one or more vectors which become columns
* The `stringAsFactors=FALSE` argument *prevents* the conversion of **text columns** to `factor`, which is what we usually want

```{r}
d = data.frame(
  num = c(3, 7, 1),
  word = c("three", "seven", "one"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
d
```

### Interactive view of a `data.frame`

* The `View` function opens an **interactive view** of a `data.frame`
* When using RStudio, the view also has **sort** and **filter** buttons
* Note: sorting or filtering the view have no effect on the object

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Table view in Rstudio", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_table_view.png")
```

### `data.frame` properties

* We can get the number of **rows** and number of **columns** in a `data.frame` with `nrow` and `ncol`, respectively - 

```{r}
nrow(d)
```

```{r}
ncol(d)
```

* Or **both** of them as a vector of length 2 with `dim` - 

```{r}
dim(d)
```

* `data.frame`s have row and column **names**, which we can get with `rownames` and `colnames`, respectively - 

```{r}
rownames(d)
```

```{r}
colnames(d)
```

* We can also **set** row or column names by assigning new values to these properties - 

```{r}
colnames(d)[1] = "Number"
d
```

```{r}
colnames(d)[1] = "num"
d
```

* `str` gives a summary of the object **structure** - 

```{r}
str(d)
```

### `data.frame` subsetting

* A `data.frame` **subset** can be obtained with the `[` operator
* A `data.frame` is a two-dimensional object, therefore the index is composed of **two vectors** -
    * The first vector refers to **rows**
    * The second vector refers to **columns**
* Each of these vectors can be one of the following **types** - 
    * `numeric` - Specifying the **indices** of rows/columns to retain
    * `character` - Specifying the **names** of rows/columns to retain
    * `logical` - Specifying **whether** to retain each row/column
* The rows or column index can be **omitted**, in which case we get all rows or all columns, respectively

```{r}
d[1, 1]        # Row 1, column 1

d[c(1, 3), 2]  # Rows 1 & 3, column 2

d[2, ]         # Row 2

d[, 2:1]       # Columns 2 & 1
```

* A subset with a **single column** can be returned as - 
    * A vector (`drop=TRUE`, the default)
    * A `data.frame` (`drop=FALSE`)
* For example - 

```{r}
d[1:2, 1]
```

```{r}
d[1:2, 1, drop = FALSE]
```

* Question: why do you think this applies to a single column, rather than a single row?

* We can also use a `character` index to specify the **names** of rows and/or columns to retain in the subset - 

```{r}
d[, "num"]
```

* The `$` operator is a shortcut for getting a **single column** from a `data.frame` -

```{r}
d$num
```

```{r}
d$word
```

Summary of subset operators in R:

| Syntax | Objects | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `x[i]` | **vector**, **table**, **matrix**, **array**, **list** | Subset `i` | 
| `x[[i]]` | vectors, **lists** | Single element `i` | 
| `x$i` | **tables**, lists | Single element `i` | 
| `x@n` | S4 objects | Slot `n` | 

Table: Subset operators in R

* The third option for a `data.frame` index is a `logical` vector, specifying **whether** to retain each row or column
* Most commonly it is used to filter `data.frame` **rows** based on the values of one or more **columns** - 

```{r}
d[d$num == 1, ]
```

```{r}
d[d$word == "seven" | d$word == "three", ]
```

* Let's go back to the Kinneret example from **Lesson 03** - 

```{r}
may = c(
  -211.92,-208.80,-208.84,-209.12,-209.01,-209.60,
  -210.24,-210.46,-211.76,-211.92,-213.13,-213.18,
  -209.74,-208.92,-209.73,-210.68,-211.10,-212.18,
  -213.26,-212.65,-212.37
)
nov = c(
  -212.79,-209.52,-209.72,-210.94,-210.85,-211.40,
  -212.01,-212.25,-213.00,-213.71,-214.78,-214.34,
  -210.93,-210.69,-211.64,-212.03,-212.60,-214.23,
  -214.33,-213.89,-213.68
)
```

* Using these vectors we will construct the following `data.frame` - 

```{r}
kineret = data.frame(year = 1991:2011, may, nov)
```

```{r}
head(kineret)
```

* Using a **logical index** we can get a subset of years when the Kinneret level in May was less than `-213` - 

```{r}
kineret[kineret$may < -213, "year"]  # Method 1
```

```{r}
kineret$year[kineret$may < -213]     # Method 2
```

* Similarly, we can get a subset with **all data** for those years - 

```{r}
kineret[kineret$may < -213, ]
```

### Creating new columns

* Assignment into a column which does not exist adds a **new column** - 

```{r}
kineret$d_nov = c(NA, diff(kineret$nov))
```

```{r}
head(kineret)
```

## Flow control

* The default is to let the computer execute **all** expressions in the same **order** they are given in the code
* Flow control commands are a way to **modify** the sequence of code execution
* We learn two flow control operators, from two categories - 
    * `if` and `else` - A **conditional**, conditioning the execution of code
    * `for` - A **loop**, executing code more than once

### Conditionals

* The purpose of the **conditional** is to condition the execution of code
* An `if`-`else` conditional in R contains the following components - 
    * The `if` keyword
    * A condition
    * Code to be executed if the condition is `TRUE`
    * The `else` keyword (optional)
    * Code to be executed if the condition is `FALSE` (optional)
* The condition needs to be evaluated to a **single logical value** (`TRUE` or `FALSE`); If it is `TRUE` then the code section after `if` is executed

* Conditional with `if` - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(condition) {
  expressions
}
```

* Conditional with `if` and `else` - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if(condition) {
  trueExpressions
} else {
  falseExpressions
}
```

* For example - 

```{r}
x = 3
x > 2

if(x > 2) print("x is large!")
```

```{r}
x = 0
x > 2

if(x > 2) print("x is large!")
```

* Now also with `else`
* The first code section is executed when the condition is `TRUE` - 

```{r}
x = 3
if(x > 2) print("x is large!") else print("x is small!")
```

* The second code section is executed when the condition is `FALSE` - 

```{r}
x = 1
if(x > 2) print("x is large!") else print("x is small!")
```

* We can use a conditional to write our own version of the `abs` function - 

```{r}
abs2 = function(x) {
  if(x >= 0) return(x) else return(-x)
}
```

* For example - 

```{r}
abs2(-3)
```

```{r}
abs2(24)
```

* Question 1: what happens when the argument of `abs2` is of length >1?
* Question 2: write a function `is_myname` that checks if the given text is your name, returning `TRUE` or `FALSE`

```{r, include=FALSE}
is_myname = function(x) x == "Michael"
```

```{r}
is_myname("Michael")
is_myname("Yossi")
```

### Loops

* A **loop** is used to execute a given code section more than once
* The number of **times** the code is executed is determined in different ways in different types of loops
* In a `for` loop, the number of times the code is executed is determined in advance based on the length of a **vector** passed to the loop
* The code is executed once for **each element** of the vector
* In each "round", the current element is assigned to a **variable** which we can use in the loop code

* A `for` loop is composed of the following parts - 
    * The `for` keyword
    * The variable name `symbol` getting the current vector value
    * The `in` keyword
    * The vector `sequence`
    * A code section `expressions`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
for(symbol in sequence) {
  expressions
}
```

* Note: the constant keywords are just `for` and `in`

* For example - 

```{r}
for(i in 1:5) print(i)
```

* The expression `print(i)` is executed 5 times, according to the length of the vector `1:5`
* Each time, `i` gets the next value of `1:5` and the code section prints `i` on screen

* The vector defining the `for` loop does not necessarily need to be numeric -

```{r}
for(b in c("Test", "One", "Two")) print(b)
```

* The expression `print(b)` is executed 3 times, according to the length of the vector `c("Test", "One", "Two")`
* Each time, `b` gets the next value of the vector and the code section prints `b` on screen

* In case the vector is numeric, it does not necessarily need to be composed of consecutive - 

```{r}
for(i in c(1,15,3)) print(i)
```

* The expression `print(i)` is executed 3 times, according to the length of the vector `c(1,15,3)`
* Each time, `i` gets the next value of the vector and the code section prints `i` on screen

* The code section does not have to use the current value of the vector - 

```{r}
for(i in 1:5) print("A")
```

* The expression `print("A")` is executed 5 times, according to the length of the vector `1:5`
* Each time, the code section prints `"A"` on screen

* The following `for` loop prints each of the numbers from 1 to 10 multiplied by 5 - 

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) print(i * 5)
```

* Question: How can we prints a multiplication table for 1-10, using a `for` loop?

```{r, echo=FALSE}
for(i in 1:10) print(i * 1:10)
```

* As another example of using a `for` loop, we can write a function named `x_in_y` 
* The function accepts **two vectors** `x` and `y`
* For each **element** in `x` the function checks if it is **found** in `y`
* It returns a `logical` vector of the same length as `x`

* For example - 

```{r, include=FALSE}
x_in_y = function(x, y) {
  result = NULL
  for(i in x) result = c(result, any(i == y))
  result
}
```

```{r}
x_in_y(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(2, 1, 5))
```

* We can use a `for` **loop** to check if each element in `x` is contained in `y` - 

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y = c(2, 1, 5)
```

```{r}
for(i in x) print(any(i == y))
```

* In a function, we can **"collect"** the results into a vector instead of printing them on screen - 

```{r}
# Version 1
x_in_y = function(x, y) {
  result = NULL
  for(i in x) result = c(result, any(i == y))
  result
}
```

```{r}
# Version 2
x_in_y = function(x, y) {
  result = rep(NA, length(x))
  for(i in 1:length(x)) result[i] = any(x[i] == y)
  result
}
```

* In fact, we don't need to write a function such as `x_in_y` ourselves; we can use the `%in%` **operator**
* The `%in%` operator, with an expression `x %in% y`, returns a `logical` vector indicating the **presence** of each element of `x` in `y` -

```{r}
1:5 %in% c(1, 2, 5)
```

```{r}
1:5 %in% c(1, 2, 3, 5)
```

```{r}
c("a", "B", "c", "ee") %in% letters
```

```{r}
c("a", "B", "c", "ee") %in% LETTERS
```

## Reading tables from a file

### Using `read.csv`

* The table `rainfall.csv` contains average **monthly rainfall** data (based on the period 1980-2010) for September-May, in 169 meteorological stations in Israel
* The table also contains station **name**, station **number**, **elevation** and **X-Y** coordinates

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The file `rainfall.csv` opened in Excel", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_table_in_excel.png")
```

* In addition to creating a table with `data.frame`, we can read an existing table **from disk**, such as from a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file
* We can read a CSV file with `read.csv` - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Windows
read.csv("C:\\Data2\\rainfall.csv")
read.csv("C:/Data2/rainfall.csv")

# Mac / Linux
read.csv("~/Dropbox/Data2/rainfall.csv")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", auto.pdf=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_import.svg")
```

* Note: the separating character on Windows is `/` or `\\`, not the familiar `\`
* In case the file path uses the **incorrect separator** `\` we get an error - 

```{r, error=TRUE}
read.csv("C:\Data2\rainfall.csv")
```

* In case the file **does not exist** we get a different error - 

```{r, error=TRUE}
read.csv("C:\\Data2\\rainfall.csv")
```

* The `stringsAsFactors` parameter of `read.csv` (and several other functions) determines whether **text columns** are converted to `factor` (default is `TRUE`)
* Usually, we want to **avoid** the conversion with `stringsAsFactors=FALSE`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv(
  "~/Dropbox/Data2/rainfall.csv", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

### The working directory

* R always points to a certain directory, knows as the **working directory**
* We can **get** the current working directory with `getwd` - 

```{r}
getwd()
```

* We can **set** a new working directory with `setwd` - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Dropbox/Data2")
```

* When **reading a file** from the working directory, we can specify just the **file name** instead of the full path - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
read.csv("rainfall.csv")
```

### Example: the `rainfall.csv` dataset structure

* Let's **read** the `rainfall.csv` file - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rainfall = read.csv(
  "rainfall.csv", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
rainfall = read.csv(
  "data/rainfall.csv", 
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

* We can also use the `head` or `tail` function which return a subset of the **first** or **last** several rows, respectively - 

```{r}
head(rainfall)
```

* We can also use the `head` or `tail` function which return a subset of the **first** or **last** several rows, respectively - 

```{r}
tail(rainfall)
```

* We can check the table **structure** with `str` - 

```{r}
str(rainfall)
```

* Question: create a plot of rainfall in January (`jan`) as function of elevation (`altitude`) based on the `rainfall` table

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Rainfall in January as function of elevation", fig.width=5, fig.height=4.5, out.width="65%"}
plot(rainfall$altitude, rainfall$jan)
```

* We can get specific information from the table trough **subsetting** and **summarizing**
* What is the elevation of the lowest and highest stations?

```{r}
min(rainfall$altitude)
```

```{r}
max(rainfall$altitude)
```

* What is the name of the lowest and highest station?

```{r}
rainfall$name[which.min(rainfall$altitude)]
```

```{r}
rainfall$name[which.max(rainfall$altitude)]
```

* How much rainfall does the `"Haifa University"` station receive in April?

```{r}
rainfall$apr[rainfall$name == "Haifa University"]
```

* We can create a **new column** through assignment - 

```{r}
rainfall$sep_oct = rainfall$sep + rainfall$oct
```

* To accomodate more complex calculations, we can also create a new column inside a `for` **loop** going over table **rows** - 

```{r}
m = c(
  "sep", "oct", "nov", "dec", "jan",
  "feb", "mar", "apr", "may"
)
for(i in 1:nrow(rainfall)) {
  rainfall$annual[i] = sum(rainfall[i, m])
}
```

```{r}
head(rainfall)
```

## The `apply` function

* The `apply` function can **replace** `for` loops, in situations when we are interested in applying the **same function** on all subsets of certain **dimension** of a `data.frame`, a `matrix` or an `array`
* In case of a table, there are two **dimensions** we can work on - 
    * **Rows** = Dimension `1`
    * **Columns** = Dimension `2`
* The `apply` function needs three arguments - 
    * `X` - The **object** we are working on: `data.frame`, `matrix` or `array`
    * `MARGIN` - The **dimension** we are working on
    * `FUN` - The **function** applied on that dimension

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The `apply` function, operating on columns (left) or rows (rigth)", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_apply.svg")
```

* For example, the `apply` function can replace a `for` loop for calculating **average** annual rainfall **per station**
* The `sum` function is applied on the **rows** dimension - 

```{r}
rainfall$annual = apply(
  X = rainfall[, m], 
  MARGIN = 1, 
  FUN = sum
)
```

* As another example, we can calculate **average** monthly rainfall **per month**
* This time, the `mean` function is applied on the **columns** dimension - 

```{r}
avg_rain = apply(rainfall[, m], 2, mean)
```

* The result `avg_rain` is a **named** `numeric` vector
* Element names correspond to **column** names of `X` - 

```{r}
avg_rain
```

* We can quickly visualize the values with `barplot` - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
barplot(avg_rain)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Average rainfall per month, among 169 stations in Israel", fig.width=7, fig.height=4.75, out.width="100%"}
barplot(avg_rain)
```

* As another example, let's use `apply` to find the station **name** with the **highest** rainfall **per month**
* The following applies `which.max` on the columns, returning the row **indices** where the maximal rainfall values are located per column - 

```{r}
max_st = apply(rainfall[, m], 2, which.max)
max_st
```

* We can get the corresponding station **names** by subsetting the `name` column using `max_st` - 

```{r}
rainfall$name[max_st]
```

* It is convenient to **combine** the names and values in a table - 

```{r}
data.frame(
  month = m,
  name = rainfall$name[max_st],
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

## Table join {#table-join}

### Joins for classification

* The `dates.csv` table contains the **dates** when each image in the raster `modis_south.tif`, which we will work with in **Lesson 05**, was taken - 

```{r}
dates = read.csv("data/MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r}
head(dates)
```

* For further analysis of the images we would like to be able to group them **by season**
* How can we calculate a new `season` **column**, specifying the season each date belongs to?

| season | months | 
|---|---|
| `"winter"` | `12`, `1`, `2` |
| `"spring"` | `3`, `4`, `5` |
| `"summer"` | `6`, `7`, `8` |
| `"fall"` | `9`, `10`, `11` |

Table: Months and seasons

One way is to **assign** each season name into a **subset** of a new `season` column. First we need to figure out the month each date belongs to:

```{r}
dates$date = as.Date(dates$date)
dates$month = format(dates$date, "%m")
dates$month = as.numeric(dates$month)
```


```{r}
dates$season[dates$month %in% c(12, 1:2)] = "winter"
dates$season[dates$month %in% 3:5] = "spring"
dates$season[dates$month %in% 6:8] = "summer"
dates$season[dates$month %in% 9:11] = "fall"
```

```{r}
head(dates)
```

* This method of classification may be inconvenient when we have many categories or complex criteria
* Another option is to use a **table join**

### Using R packages

* All object definitions (including functions) in R are contained in **packages**
* To use a particular object, we need to -
    * **Install** the package with `install.packages` (once)
    * **Load** the package using the `library` function (in each new R session)
    * Loading a package basically means the code we downloaded is **executed**, loading all objects the package defined into the **RAM**
* All function calls we used until now did require this. Why? Because several packages are **installed** along with R and **loaded** on R start-up
* There are several more packages which are installed by default but **not loaded** on start-up (total of ~30)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Packages included with R^[R in a Nutshell, 2010.]", out.width="30%", auto.pdf=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_r_packages_a.svg")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Packages included with R (zoom-in)^[R in a Nutshell, 2010.]", out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_r_packages_a.svg")
```

Most of the [~15,000 R packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/) (as of Sep 2019) are *not* installed by default. To use one of these packages we first need to **install** it on the computer. Installing a package is a one-time operation using the `install.packages` function. After the package is installed, each time we want to use it we need to **load** it using `library`. 

In the next example we use a package called `dplyr`. This package is not installed with R, we need to **install** it ourselves:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

If the package is already installed, running `install.packages` overwrites the old installation. This is done intentionally if you you want to install a newer version of the package. Once the package is already installed, we need to use the `library` function to load it into memory. Note how package name can be passed to `library` without quotes: 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

Other than `dplyr`, the main packages that we are going to use in the book are `stars`, `sf`, `units`, `gstat` and `automap`. 

### Joining tables with `left_join`

The `left_join` function from `dplyr` does a **left join** between tables. The first two parameters are the tables that need to be joined, `x` and `y`. The third `by` parameter is the common column name(s) by which the tables need to be joined. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Join types^[http://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html]", out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_join_types.png")
```

Next we prepare a table `tab` with the **classification** of months into seasons:

```{r}
tab = data.frame(
  month = c(12, 1:11),
  season = rep(c("winter","spring","summer","fall"), each = 3),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

* Next we prepare a table `tab` with the classification of months into seasons - 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tab
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, size="scriptsize"}
tab
```

* Now we can **join** the `dates` and `tab` tables 
* Before that, we **remove** the `season` column we manually created in the previous example -

```{r}
library(dplyr)

dates$season = NULL
dates = left_join(dates, tab, by = "month")
```

```{r}
head(dates)
```

## Writing tables to file

* Using `write.csv` we can **write** the contents of a `data.frame` to a **CSV file** -

```{r}
write.csv(dates, "data/MOD13A3_2000_2019_dates2.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

* The `row.names` parameter determines whether the **row names** are saved
* Note: like in `read.csv`, we can either give a **full** file path or just the **file name**; if the specify just the file name then the file is written to the **working directory**

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", auto.pdf=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/lesson_04_export.svg")
```
